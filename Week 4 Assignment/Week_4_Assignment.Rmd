__Answer 4:__  

 * <a name="1a"/> __Answer 4a:__ `[0-9]+\\$` is a regular expression that means it will match any object where there is at least one digit before a `$` sign.

_Example:_
```{r}
library(stringr)
four.a <- c("Sue is 2$nd place", "Fred is 3", "550$", "5th is Jen", "Nile is number$ 9")
unlist(str_extract(four.a, "[0-9]+\\$"))
```

* <a name="1b"/> __Answer 4b:__ `\\b[a-z]{1,4}\\b` is a regular expression that means any match any cases where the object have letters from a to z (lower case), at least once but no more the 4 times. Meaning match the instance where there is one lower case letter or up to 4 letter words.

_Example:_
```{r}
four.b <- "I think sunsets are very beautiful. The best place to see it is near a body of water."
str_extract(four.b, "\\b[a-z]{1,4}\\b")
unlist(str_extract_all(four.b, "\\b[a-z]{1,4}\\b"))
```

[Up](#A)

* <a name="1c"/> __Answer 4c:__ `.*?\\.txt$` is a regular expression that means match any cases where the object ends in .txt. The first part of the expression `.*?` means does not matter what comes before `.txt`.

_Example:_
```{r}
four.c <- c("web: abd/nyc.org/assignment.txt", "nml/like.edu/4txt.cvs", "cdn/fyc.com/four.txt")
unlist(str_extract_all(four.c, ".*?\\.txt$")) 
```

*  <a name="1d"/> __Answer 4d:__ `\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{4}` is a regular expression that means two digits then two digits then four digits separated by `/`. Usually the this type of format can be used to get dates, two digit month and day and four digit year, in the format of dd/mm/yyyy or mm/dd/yyyy.

_Example:_
```{r}
four.d <- "He was born on February 7th 1940. His father died on 07/18/1953. At the Age of 13/14 he had to drop out to school and start work. He had his first child on 01/06/1966. He boarded the ship on 12/24/1968."
unlist(str_extract_all(four.d, "\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{4}"))
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
<(.+?)>.+?</\\1>
```

* <a name="1e"/> __Answer 4e:__ The regular expression above means to find the object inside `<>` in the beginning and the same `<>` with a `/` in the beginning of the object, later in the string. It is hard to explain so I will break down the regular expression above to show what it means part by part, with the example below. First look at the beginning `<(.+?)>`, which means to match any object surrounded by `<>` no matter it is text or numeric. Next, let's look at the last part in the `<>`. The `\\1` is back reference to the text in the beginning `.+?` enclosed in parenthesis `()`. So another way to see it is: match anything that we found inside `<>` in the first part and look for the a object that inside`<>` that has the same contain as before except with a `/` in the front. The middle `.+?` means that include anything that comes between the first and last part. As you can see on the bottom example: `R` matched `4ever21` and `/4ever21` enclosed in `<>` and everything in between the two object.


_Example:_

```{r}
four.e <- c("This is <4ever21> an  example.  Not a long example </4ever21>. Very small example.")
unlist(str_extract_all(four.e, "<(.+?)>.+?</\\1>"))
```

__Answer 5:__
  
 <a name="2"/> `[0-9]+\\$` is a regular expression that I have rewritten as `[[:digit:]]{1,}[$]` . I use the expression `[[:digit:]]{1,}[$]` by enclosing the `[:digit:]` class in a `[]` to indicate  that we are looking for digits, same as saying `[0-9]`. I also added the `{1,}` to match the class one or more times, same as using a +. Then I used `[$]` to state that I am looking of $ in the vector, same as saying `\\$`.

_Let's look at the same vector at answer four a:_
```{r}
four.a <- c("Sue is 2$nd place", "Fred is 1$2", "550$", "5th is Jen", "Nile is number$ 9")
unlist(str_extract(four.a, "[0-9]+\\$"))
unlist(str_extract(four.a, "[[:digit:]]{1,}[$]")) 
```

__Answer 6: Consider the mail address chunkylover53[at]aol[dot]com.__  

 * <a name="3a"/> __Answer 6a:__ I transform the above sting to a standard mail address using regular expression. I used the `stingr` package's `str_replace_all` function to replace `[at]` and `[dot]` to `@` and `.` respectively.

```{r}
six.a <- "Consider the mail address chunkylover53[at]aol[dot]com."
six.a <- str_replace_all(six.a, pattern = "\\[at]", replacement = "@")
six.a <- str_replace_all(six.a, pattern = "\\[dot]", replacement = ".")
six.a
```

* <a name="3b"/> __Answer 6b:__ To extract the digits in the mail address we first try to use `[:digit:]` but that does not work as you can see below. It only gives us one digit at a time. It shows "5" and "3" not "53" which we want.

```{r}
unlist(str_extract_all(six.a, "[:digit:]"))
```


Then I use the expression `[[:digit:]]{1,}` which gives us the correct number "53". I enclose the `[:digit:]` in a `[]` to indicate that we are looking at the predefined class `[:digit:]`. I also added the `{1,}` to match the class one or more times.

```{r}
unlist(str_extract_all(six.a, "[[:digit:]]{1,}"))
```


[Up](#A)

* <a name="3c"/> __Answer 6c:__ We want to extract the digits from the mail without using the predefined class `[:digit:]`. First we try using `\\D` to get the digits but it does not work out as we can see below.

```{r}
unlist(str_extract_all(six.a, "\\D"))
```

The reason `\\D` does not give us any digit is because the expression is the same as `[^[:digit:]]`, which means any characters __except__ digits. The correct way to write is with a lower case d not an upper case D, like: `\\d` . 

I use the expression `\\d{1,}` which gives us the number "53". I use `\\d` to get all the digits. I also added the `{1,}` to match previous case one or more times.

```{r}
unlist(str_extract_all(six.a, "\\d{1,}"))
```
